### Variants Versus Instances
* A **Variant** is a logical, canonical, semi-canonical, or popular fanon version.
  * "The Warden" (Dragon Age) has canonical variants like "Female Warden" "Female Dwarf Noble Warden" and fanon variants for Non-Binary Wardens
  * "The Doctor" (Dr. Who) has the variants "Third Doctor", "Tenth Doctor"

* An **Instance** is a specific, customisable character for a request, offer, fanwork, etc.
  * Instances allow for personalization (e.g., AU traits, gender identity, background) without altering the underlying variant.
  * An instance of Kaidan Alenko (Mass Effect) could be a trans masc character from East Texas in a cowboys AU I just made up
